Based on https://github.com/syssi/esphome-seplos-bms - added Balancing State and FET states. To be used with my HA dashboard: https://github.com/michi1984/Home-Assistant-Dashboards/blob/main/Seplos%20Battery%20Dashboard

Requirements: Home Assistant with installed ESPHome integration. Adjust RX/TX pins to your own!
